Many of these areas of concern can be directly tied back to the levels of Toxic and Non-Toxic Essential Elements found in the body. This analysis will help identify if there are specific elements that could support improvement of those struggles in children with ASD during their developmental journey by means of eliminating or balancing the common toxic elements present in these urine analyses.
